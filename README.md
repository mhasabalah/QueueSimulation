# Queue Simulation

**Consider a computer technical support center  where personnel take calls and  provide service. There are two technical support people – Able and Baker (multi  server system). Able is more experienced and can provide service faster than  Baker. Rule: “Able gets the call if both technical support people are idle”. The  distribution of times between customer arrivals and the service times are shown in  table.**


| Inter-arrival  time | 0 | 2 | 4 | 4 | 2 | 2 |
|---------------------|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Service  time       | 5 | 3 | 3 | 5 | 6 | 3 |

 1. Suggest  other  performance  measures  that  could  be  used  to  evaluate  the  system.
 2. Specify:  Sate  variables,  Entities,  Events,  and  Activities  you  will  use  to  describe  the system
 3. Draw  the  event  diagram  for  you  simulation.
 4. Simulate  the system.  Make  sure  you  clearly  show  the  simulation  clock  and the  event  list.
 5. Calculate  the  Average  waiting  time  of  those  who  wait  in  queue  _d(n)._
 6. Calculate  the  Time-average  number  in queue _q(n)._
 7. Calculate  the  total  busy  time  B(t)
 8. Calculate  the  utilization  _u(n)_ of  the  server.
 9. Calculate  the average  service  time.
 10. Calculate  the  average  waiting  time. 
 11. Calculate  the  average  time  customer  spends  in  the  system.
 12. Calculate  the  Throughput.

**Repeat  the  simulation  of  Question,  In  case  that Able  is  alone  (without Baker).**
